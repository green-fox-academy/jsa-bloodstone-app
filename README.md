My Kingdom is an RPG mobile game located in space.

In this game the user will establish a kingdom during registration on a chosen planet.

After logging in to the application, the user will see their kingdom’s 4 main buildings: a townhall, an academy, a mine, and a farm.

- the troops, who will fight the kingdom’s battles, are living in the townhall, and the user also stores their gold there
- the academy will create troops, one by one
- the mine will mine gold for the user
- the troops will get their food from the farm

The troops can be on different level. By default they are created on level 1, with the attack and defense value of 1. 
Later on the user can upgrade their troops in exchange of gold, so they will be stronger when it comes to a battle.

If the user want’s to have a battle with another user, they can attack them. 
In this case the user have to choose a planet, so they can see it’s residents, and start a battle with them.

The user can list the top ranked users on the Leaderboard, and also see their own ranking.
